<p>The Von Neumann architecture, proposed by John von Neumann in 1945, is a foundational model for modern computers. Here are the key components and concepts:

    Central Processing Unit (CPU):
    Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
    Control Unit (CU): Directs operations of the processor, fetching and executing instructions.
    Registers: Small, fast storage locations within the CPU for temporary data storage.
    Memory:
    Stores both data and program instructions. This is a key feature of the Von Neumann architecture, known as the stored-program concept.
    Input/Output (I/O) Devices:
    Interfaces for interacting with external devices, such as keyboards, monitors, and printers.
    Buses:
    Communication pathways that transfer data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
    A notable characteristic of the Von Neumann architecture is the Von Neumann bottleneck, which refers to the limitation caused by using a single bus for both data and instructions, potentially slowing down the system123.
    
    This architecture is simpler compared to the Harvard architecture, which uses separate buses for data and instructions, but it has been fundamental in the development of </p>
