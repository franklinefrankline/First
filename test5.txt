<p> systems software: Software that provides
    services that are commonly useful, including operating systems,
    compilers, loaders, and assemblers.</p> 
<p> operating system: Supervising program that manages the resources of a
    computer for the benefit of the programs that run on that computer.</p>
   <p> compiler : A program that translates high-level language statements into 
    assembly language statement</p>
   <p> binary digit: Also called a bit, One of the two numbers in base 2 (0 or 1) that
    are the components of information.</p>
   <p> instruction :A command that computer hardware understands and obeys.</p>

   <P> high-level programming language :A portable language such as
    C,C++, Java, or Visual Basic that is composed of words and
    algebraic notation that can be translated by a compiler into assembly language.</P>
  <p>  input device: A mechanism through which the computer is fed information, such
    as the keyboard or mouse.</p>
   <p> output device :A mechanism that conveys the result of a computation to a user
    or another computer.</p>
  <p>  motherboard :A plastic board containing packages of integrated circuits or chips , 
   including processor, cache, memory, and connectors for I/O devices such as networks and 
   disks.</p> 
   <p> integrated circuit: Also called a chip. A device combining dozens to millions of 
   transistors.</p>
   <p> Memory: The storage area in which programs are kept when they are running and that 
   contains the data needed by the running programs.</p>

   <p> dynamic random access memory (DRAM): Memory built as an integrated 
   circuit; it provides random access to any location.</p>
   <p> dual inline memory module (DIMM):A small board that contains DRAM chips on 
   both sides. (SIMMs have DRAMs on only one side.)</p>
  <p>  central processor unit (CPU): Also called processor. The active part of the 
   computer, which contains the datapath and control and which adds numbers, tests 
   numbers, signals I/O devices to activate, and so on.</p>
   <p> Control: The component of the processor that commands the datapath, memory, 
   and 1/0 devices according to the instructions of the program.</p>
   <p> main memory: Also called primary memory. Memory used to hold programs while 
   they are running; typically consists of DRAM in today's computers.</p>
  <p>  secondary memory: Nonvolatile memory used to store programs and data 
   between runs; typically consists of magnetic disks in today's computers.</p>
